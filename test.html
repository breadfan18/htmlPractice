                    metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going
                    back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "paris"><h1>Paris</h1>
                <p>Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture.
                    Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. </p>
                <p>Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral,
                    the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "tokyo"><h1>Tokyo</h1>
                <p>Tokyo, Japan’s busy capital, mixes the ultramodern and the traditional, from neon-lit skyscrapers to historic temples.
                    The opulent Meiji Shinto Shrine is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods.</p>
                <p> The Imperial Palace sits amid large public gardens. The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from
                    classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater (in the Edo-Tokyo Museum).</p>
